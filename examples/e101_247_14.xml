         <editorialDecl>
            <p>The guiding principle is to make this edition of the accounts of the medieval Irish
               Exchequer (and other medieval records populating Beyond 2022 Virtual Record Treasury)
               as intelligible as possible to as wide an audience as possible. To that end, due to
               their generally brief, formulaic nature the records are more or less directly
               translated into modern English without losing the literal, technical sense of the
               original language, which is almost exclusively Latin.</p>
